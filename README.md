Goal

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. By analyzing features, such as class, gender, age, number of children, number of parents, fare, and more, in the Titanic passenger dataset, we trained eight different machine learning models and selected the one with the highest accuracy score to build an application that can predict whether a given passenger would have survived this disaster or not.
